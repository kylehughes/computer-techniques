## Ingredients

*This makes 7 servings, where each serving is ½ of a wide-mouth Mason jar.*

- **6 cups** water
- **1½ cups** steel-cut oatmeal [^ratio]
- **½ cup** rolled oatmeal [^ratio]
- **1 cup** flaxseed meal
- **4 tbsp** brown sugar
- **2 tbsp** cinnamon [^adjust]
- **2 cups** raisins [^adjust]

## Directions

*Do not fill your pressure cooker beyond halfway when cooking oatmeal. It will foam while cooking and the foam needs space to fill.*

1. Coat the pot of the electric pressure cooker with cooking spray. Wipe the top edge of the pot with a towel to remove any excess spray.
2. Add all of the ingredients *except the raisins* to the pot and stir to combine.
3. Close and lock the lid. Move the pressure valve to "Seal."
4. Pressure-cook for 12 minutes on Manual + High Pressure.
5. When done, let the pressure cooker release naturally. If the pressure is not released within 15 minutes you may manually release the pressue.
6. Add the raisins to the pot and stir to combine. Stir until the mixture is mostly homogenous.
7. Put the pressure cooker lid back on and let sit for 5 minutes.
8. Serve and/or store. It should keep in the refrigerator for four days. Any longer and it should be put in the freezer.

[^ratio]: The proper ratio of steel-cut:rolled oats (4:1) comes from Will Smith (not that one) on [Episode 4 of the *Brad & Will Made a Tech Pod.* podcast](https://techpod.content.town/episodes/4-a-bomb-that-sits-on-your-stove). He claims that this mimicks the Starbucks recipe.

[^adjust]: The cinnamon and raisin can be excluded or adjusted to your preference.
